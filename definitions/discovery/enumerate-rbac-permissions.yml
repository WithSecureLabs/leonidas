  List the RBAC permissions assigned to the current entity

  In the early stages of a breach attackers will aim to list the permissions they have within the compromised environment. In a Kubernetes cluster, this can be achieved by interacting with the SelfSubjectAccessReview API, e.g. via "kubectl auth" command. This will enumerate the Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC) rules defining the compromised user's authorization.
