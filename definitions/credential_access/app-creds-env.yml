  Attempt to Access Application Credentials in Environmemt Variables 

  Developers store secrets in the Kubernetes configuration files, such as environment variables in the pod configuration. These variables can be listed within the description of pods.

  This test case only simulates a standard "list" operation, although the same result can also be achieved with a  "watch" operation. The associated detection shall therefore not be considered complete, but only a 1-to-1 match of this particular test case.

    - get pods might be performed for various legitimate reasons. Stronger detections could be based on a correlation search for subsequent activity making use of environment variables
