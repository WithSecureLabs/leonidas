  Access secrets within our own pod's filesystem

  This test case simulates an adversary within a pod e.g. in the case of a compromised workload. As this operation would not go through the API server, no Audit event will be recorded and therefore no detection signature can be authored with the log sources currently available to Sigmahq. Instead, the detection's log source is set to the non-existent "Falco" source, should equivalent functionality be onboarded in the future.
