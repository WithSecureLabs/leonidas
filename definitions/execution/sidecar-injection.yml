  Inject a sidecar container into a running deployment 
  
  A sidecar container is an additional container that resides alongside the main container within the pod. Containers can be added to running resources like Deployments/DeamonSets/StatefulSets by means of "kubectl patch". By injecting a new container within a legitimate pod attackers can run their code and hide their activity, instead of running their own separated pod in the cluster.
